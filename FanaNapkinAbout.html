      FanaNapkin has been proudly making face-napkins since its inception in late 1993. We were founded by Talia Colombo after she realized she had no easy way to get napkins with faces. Realizing the oppertunity to fill a need in the market, Talia began creating custom napkins from her garage. Her business soon outgrew said garage, so she began opening several outposts. Eventually, in 2009, FanaNapkin transitioned to a fully online boutique. We have since expanded to all 50 states and 23 countries. We are very proud to contiune to be the sole provider for face-napkins in North America and Europe.
